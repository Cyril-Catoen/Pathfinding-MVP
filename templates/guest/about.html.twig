                <div class="container-type-3">
                    <div class="w50">
                        <p>It all started with a personal adventure. Alone, driven by a desire to explore wild and untouched lands, I set out to cross several remote natural areas on foot.
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite careful preparation, good resource management, and sharing my itinerary with a relative, I quickly came face-to-face with the unexpected. Rapidly changing weather, altitude, partially unsuitable gear, lack of mobile network, and isolation turned what was meant to be a multi-day hike into a real ordeal.
                        </p>
                        <p>I found myself in critical situations, sometimes completely lost, with real risks to my safety. One time, a bad slip—thrown to the ground by strong wind despite using trekking poles—on a snowy slope that was icy in places, nearly ended badly. A week later, even with improved gear, a sudden downpour forced me to take shelter for several days in an unstaffed hut, completely cut off from the world, soaked, and freezing.
                        </p>
                        <p>Those moments were a turning point. They made me realize just how important it is to share your itinerary, reassure your loved ones, and have a reliable tool in case something goes wrong.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="w50">
                        <p>Back home, I decided to change direction. Instead of building yet another recipe app, inventory manager, or social media clone, I wanted to create something useful. Something real. A tool that answered a need I had lived through.
                        </p>
                        <p>Pathfinding was born from that desire. A platform designed for both novice adventurers and seasoned explorers. It allows anyone to plan and share their routes, activate an intelligent safety system, and eventually benefit from a satellite-based GPS tracking feature.
                        </p>
                        <p>But Pathfinding is also a community. A place where members can find adventure partners, help each other, and share their experience. Because adventure is a personal journey — but it should never be faced completely alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>“To get going, you only need answers to 5% of your questions; the remaining 95% come along the way. Those who wait for 100% of the answers stay put.” - Mike Horn
